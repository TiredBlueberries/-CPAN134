   <p id="starter"> <span class="w">W</span> to my site. Please come in and stay awhile.<p>
    I started this web site because Halloween has always been my favorite hohliday. But during the
    <br>last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a
    <br>hit.
    <br>
    <br>
    If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and
    <br>films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.
